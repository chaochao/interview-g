how you would productionize your submission:

Geo Search: Replace the current in-memory geo search with database-level geo-indexing to ensure scalability and efficient query performance.

Word Search: Use fuzzy matching instead of simple text matching to handle typos, variations, and improve overall search relevance.

Pagination: Add pagination support to manage large datasets efficiently and prevent performance degradation from returning all results at once.

Sorting: Ensure results are sorted by distance by default to improve user experience and make search results more meaningful.

Multi-Parameter Search: Extend functionality to allow filtering and sorting by multiple parameters, such as popularity, rating, and more, for richer search capabilities.
